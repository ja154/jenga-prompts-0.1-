# Universal Video Prompt Engineering Framework

## FRAMEWORK PHILOSOPHY
**"Every video is a journey through time that must captivate instantly. Great video prompts orchestrate every frame and sound to serve a singular narrative purpose."**

## CORE ARCHITECTURE: The VICES Method (Adapted for Video)

### **V**isual & Narrative Hierarchy
### **I**ntent & Narrative Context
### **C**inematography & Technical Specs
### **E**diting, Pacing & Emotional Arc
### **S**ound & Production Bridge

---

## 1. VISUAL & NARRATIVE HIERARCHY LAYER

### **Attention Flow Architecture (Temporal)**
```json
{
  "key_scenes": {
    "opening_hook": "What is the first thing the viewer sees and hears to grab attention?",
    "inciting_incident": "The event that kicks off the main narrative or action.",
    "midpoint_shift": "A major change in direction or stakes.",
    "climax": "The peak of tension and narrative culmination.",
    "resolution": "The concluding visual and narrative state."
  },
  "shot_hierarchy": {
    "primary_shots": "Key 'hero' shots that define the video (e.g., establishing shots, dramatic close-ups).",
    "a_roll": "Primary footage, typically dialogue or main action.",
    "b_roll": "Supplemental footage to enrich the story and cover edits.",
    "temporal_flow": "How the viewer's attention is guided from one shot to the next."
  },
  "hierarchy_validation": {
    "3_second_test": "Is the core premise clear within the first 3 seconds?",
    "re-watch_test": "Are there details that reward a second viewing?",
    "clarity_test": "Does the sequence of shots logically build the narrative?"
  }
}
```

### **Impact Optimization:**
- **Instant Engagement**: Core concept is compelling within 3 seconds.
- **Narrative Clarity**: The story or message is understandable without narration if possible.
- **Emotional Trajectory**: Evokes the intended sequence of feelings.
- **Memorability Factor**: Contains a distinctive visual or narrative hook that lingers.

## 2. INTENT & NARRATIVE CONTEXT LAYER

### **Purpose-Driven Foundation**
```json
{
  "primary_intent": {
    "communication_goal": "Inform/Persuade/Inspire/Entertain/Document",
    "target_emotion_arc": "The sequence of feelings to evoke (e.g., curiosity -> tension -> relief).",
    "call_to_action": "What should viewers do after watching?",
    "success_metric": "Views/Watch time/Engagement/Conversion/Artistic impact."
  },
  "audience_context": {
    "demographic": "Age/culture/interests/expertise level.",
    "viewing_platform": "YouTube/TikTok/Cinema/Website embed.",
    "attention_span": "Designed for quick scrolls or focused viewing.",
    "device_context": "Mobile (vertical)/Desktop (horizontal)/TV."
  },
  "narrative_context": {
    "genre": "Documentary/Action/Comedy/Thriller/Advertisement.",
    "story_type": "Hero's journey/Explainer/Montage/Day in the life.",
    "cultural_sensitivity": "Symbols, themes, and music to use or avoid."
  }
}
```

### **Context Validation Matrix:**
- **Audience Match**: Is the story and style relevant to the target viewers?
- **Platform Optimization**: Is the pacing, aspect ratio, and length suited for the platform?
- **Narrative Coherence**: Does the video tell a clear, compelling story?
- **Brand/Creator Fit**: Does the video feel authentic to the source?

## 3. CINEMATOGRAPHY & TECHNICAL SPECS LAYER

### **Visual Language Blueprint**
```json
{
  "cinematography_style": {
    "camera_movement": "Static/Handheld/Dolly/Drone/FPV.",
    "shot_composition": "Rule of thirds/Symmetry/Leading lines within shots.",
    "framing": "Wide/Medium/Close-up/Dutch angle.",
    "focus_technique": "Deep focus/Shallow depth of field/Rack focus."
  },
  "lighting_system": {
    "lighting_style": "High-key/Low-key/Naturalistic/Cinematic.",
    "color_palette_in_motion": "Dominant colors and how they shift between scenes.",
    "color_temperature": "Warm/Cool/Neutral/Contrasting.",
    "contrast_strategy": "High contrast for drama/Low contrast for softness."
  },
  "technical_specifications": {
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9 (Landscape)/9:16 (Portrait)/2.35:1 (Cinematic).",
    "resolution": "1080p/4K/8K.",
    "frame_rate": "24fps (cinematic)/30fps (standard)/60fps (smooth/slow-mo).",
    "file_format": "MP4/MOV."
  }
}
```

### **Technical Excellence Checklist:**
- **Visual Consistency**: Style is maintained throughout the video.
- **Legibility**: Key subjects are clearly visible and well-lit.
- **Motion Quality**: Movement (camera and subject) is smooth and intentional.
- **Format Appropriateness**: Specs are optimized for the primary viewing platform.

## 4. EDITING, PACING & EMOTIONAL ARC LAYER

### **Temporal & Emotional Architecture**
```json
{
  "editing_style": {
    "cut_frequency": "Fast cuts for action/Slow cuts for drama.",
    "transition_style": "Hard cuts/Fades/Wipes/Match cuts/J-cuts.",
    "rhythm_and_flow": "The overall tempo of the edit, often tied to music.",
    "visual_effects": "Subtle VFX/Obvious CGI/Motion graphics."
  },
  "pacing_framework": {
    "overall_pace": "Relaxed/Energetic/Escalating.",
    "dwell_time": "How long key shots are held to allow for impact.",
    "attention_hooks": "Moments designed to re-engage a drifting viewer (e.g., sound effect, quick cut)."
  },
  "emotional_arc_design": {
    "primary_emotion_sequence": "The intended journey, e.g., from calm to chaotic to calm.",
    "emotional_intensity": "How strongly each emotion is portrayed.",
    "mood_descriptors": "Adjectives for the video's feel (e.g., 'uplifting, nostalgic, and hopeful')."
  }
}
```

### **Pacing & Emotional Coherence Test:**
- **Rhythm Consistency**: The editing style supports the overall mood.
- **Emotional Alignment**: The pacing and visuals match the intended emotional journey.
- **Flow**: The video feels seamless and holds attention from start to finish.
- **Hook Effectiveness**: The opening is strong enough to stop scrolling.

## 5. SOUND & PRODUCTION BRIDGE LAYER

### **Auditory & Creation Guide**
```json
{
  "sound_design": {
    "primary_audio": "Dialogue/Voiceover/Music.",
    "ambient_sound": "Background noise that establishes the environment.",
    "sound_effects": "SFX used to emphasize actions or create mood.",
    "music": "Genre, tempo, and role of the score or soundtrack (e.g., 'epic orchestral score')."
  },
  "production_logistics": {
    "location_needs": "The setting for the video.",
    "talent_direction": "Actions, emotions, and dialogue delivery for on-screen talent.",
    "prop_requirements": "Key objects needed in the scenes."
  },
  "post_production": {
    "color_grading": "Specific look (e.g., 'teal and orange blockbuster look', 'desaturated vintage feel').",
    "text_integration": "Typography for titles, lower thirds, or captions.",
    "version_variations": "Different cuts for different platforms (e.g., a 15s trailer from a 2m video)."
  }
}
```

### **Production Reality Check:**
- **Sound-Vision Synergy**: Does the audio enhance the visuals and narrative?
- **Clarity of Sound**: Is key audio (dialogue, key SFX) clear and balanced?
- **Achievability**: Can the requested scenes and sounds be plausibly generated?
- **Quality Standards**: Does the prompt describe a high-quality final product?

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**"Great video prompts don't just describe what to filmâ€”they architect the entire viewing experience over time, from the first frame to the final sound."**
